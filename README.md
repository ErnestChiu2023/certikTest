# certikTest

Hey Certik, the project that I have chosen for this challenge is 'project A, the collaborative working application'. I utilized React and Node.js to develop a web application where users can upload and simulateously edit files. This was done by creating a socket between the open editors. Furthermore, the application saves these files on the cloud within s3. 

One part of the application that felt a bit strange to me was the utilization of a local variable to store a cache of the user's file before they hit the save button. If time permitted I may have utilized redis instead of just a single variable. 

In terms of the time spent on the project, I utilized around 6 hours on the project with the following breakdown

1 hour -> research/reading documenation
2 hours -> implementing the socket and the simulanteous editing of files
2 hours -> implementing the express app and supporting multiple files on the application (upload/creating a new file)
1 hour -> clean up and documentation

Overall, I had a great time working on this project as I got to learn a bit more about sockets and have enjoyed this opportunity.

Looking forward to Hearing Back!
